        <h2>Seems like you have lost your way...</h2>
        OH AREN'T YOU?
        <br><br> I guess you haven't heard the terrible stories about this cave.
        <br> The legend says that all the people who entered the cave - never seen again.
        <br> Anyway, I am not gonna stop you.
        <br> But if you find your death inside there...don't blame me.
        <br><br><br> Are you still there? GREAT.
        <br> Your mission is to find all the mines locations inside the cave.
        <br> Once you do it - you will find your way out.
        <br><br><br> Oh! I almost forgot something.
        <br> I left you some hints that you'll be able to use during your journey.
        <br>
        <br> GOOD LUCK
